VSite Score

Gives every vsite a score based on the activity going on inside it. 
This activity goes down over time. 

Every action is given a point value. More scholarly significant actions give more points.
Eg.
Uploading a Bio:  5 points
Uploading a publication: 30 points 

Original intent is to put most active sites on top of Featured Sites list 
on http://scholar.harvard.edu/
